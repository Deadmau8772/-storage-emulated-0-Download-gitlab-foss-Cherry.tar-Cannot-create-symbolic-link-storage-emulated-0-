opam2web
========

A tool to generate a website from an OPAM universe

This utility creates a static website from an OPAM universe, listing all
available packages and their details. A homepage and OPAM documentation is 
included as well.

The latest release of opam2web is available via
[opam](http://opam.ocaml.org). To install, simply run:
```bash
opam install opam2web
```

### Build

To build the `opam2web` utility, enter:
```bash
make
```
The binary will be located in src/_build/opam2web.native after compilation.

To generate the static website corresponding to the `default` remote in the
local OPAM installation, enter:
```bash
make -C src run
```

### Usage

```bash
opam2web [options]* [repositories]*
```

Each repository is namespaced by its type:
- `path:*`
    A repository at the following local file system path.
- `local:*`
    The repository corresponding to a named opam remote.
- `opam:`
    The current local opam universe.

The order of repositories determines their priority when generating the
opam universe to use. Earlier repositories are higher priority.

If no repository is given, the current local opam universe is used.

Some available options are:
- `--output / -o [directory]`
    The directory where to write the generated HTML files.
- `--content / -c [direcory]`
    The directory where to find documentation and templates to use.
    Defaults to 'content'.
- `--where [comma-separated predicate list]`
    A package's satisfaction of all of the predicates in any of the
    lists implies generation.
- `--index (all|where)`
    Control which packages to include in the universe index.
- `--help / -help`
    Display the list of options.

Some available predicates are:
- `tag:*`
- `depopt`
- `not:*`
- `repo:*`
- `pkg:*`

For complete command-line configuration options, run
```bash
opam2web --help
```

#### Example

```bash
opam2web -o website path:~/myrepo local:default
```
will generate the HTML files corresponding to the repository located in 
`~/myrepo` and the remote named `default` in the local OPAM installation.
Resulting files will be located in the `website` directory.

### TODO

- More complex news system (one page per news, Markdown...)
- More complex statistics (graphics over time...)
